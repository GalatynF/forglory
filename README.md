## Description

In this mod, you have a new bar displayed on your screen: ***the adrenalin bar!*** But what is adrenalin, how do you gain it, and why is it useful?
Remember the keyword of this mod: **ATTACK!**

### Adrenalin system

You will notice **4 thresholds** on your adrenalin bar. Each threshold allows you to use the feat you have in this tier *(explained after)*.
Depending on your current adrenalin level, you may or not gain adrenalin in every possible way. But remember that you will always be losing adrenalin 
if you're not doing anything special, and you will lose it even quicker if sneaking.

* **Sprinting:** the easiest way to get adrenalin, also the smallest gain. Efficient till tier 2

* **Jumping:** a good way to get adrenalin till tier 2

* **Eating:** an alternative for people who hate running
  * ***Golden apple:*** get your adrenalin directly to tier 1 threshold
  * ***Enchanted golden apple:*** get your adrenalin directly to tier 3 threshold

* **Being hurt:** not the safest way to get adrenalin as it supposed to get damaged, but quite efficient. Mob attacks, falling from high, ... you won't **ever** regret being low life *(joking, you will because you gonna die right after it)*

* **Attacking:** definitely **THE** way to get adrenalin

* **DEATH:** the supreme way to get adrenalin! But you lose everything at respawn, not really worth it... don't die

When reaching **tier 4 threshold**, you enter the *overcharged* mod. You will stay in this tier for a certain amount of time and then your adrenalin will keep 
decreasing, no matter what you are doing, till you lost your whole adrenalin.

### Essence

In the world, a new structure can spawn: ***the lost sanctuary***. A few gifts are waiting for you there, including a new block: ***the essence infuser***.

* **Using:** Standing on it using a powered gem will give you the power of the gem. You may do this an infinite number of times as long as you don't break the block

* **Charging:** If you want to bring the block home, breaking it will make it not infinite anymore. In order to use it again, you will need to charge it with ***essence*** before each use

* **Breaking:** After a *not-too-short* time breaking it, you will get the block and 1 to 3 essences if it was infinite, 0 to 1 if only charged

### Gems

To get a feat you got it: you need different ***gems***. A gem is the basis of a power. It can be a damage, a heal, a miscellaneous, or a mobility one.

* **Powered gems:** Those gems are associated with a specific feat. You need a basic gem to create a tier 1 powered gem

* **More powered gems:** If you want to create a better tier gem, you will need a gem of the same power and of the previous tier. So yes, tier 4 needs a lot of basis gems

* **Using:** When you get the feat of a powered gem *(standing on a charged essence infuser)*, the essence infuser will consume it and give you back the basis gem associated and 0 to 1 essence

### Feats

Now you got your feat(s), there are a few things you need to know:

* **4 Tiers:** There are 4 tiers of feats that you can get. And you can get it in any order, with any kind of power

* **Not more:** If you try to get a tier 1 feat while you already had one, the new feat will replace the old one

* **Not dead yet:** Even if you die ~~(and you will)~~, you keep your powers

For a list of every feat, download the mod. Try, it's fun (and free!)

## Commands

* **Activate feat:** Some tier 2 feats may need a keybind to activate. ***LEFT ALT key***

Note that you can change keybinds at any moment in Minecraft control options.
