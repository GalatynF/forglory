## Description

In this mod, you have a new bar displayed on your screen: ***the adrenalin bar !*** But what is adrenalin, how do you increase it, and why is it useful?
Remember the keyword of this mod: **ATTACK!**

### Adrenalin system

You will notice **4 thresholds** on your adrenalin bar. Each threshold allows you to use the feat you have in this tier *(explained below)*.
Depending on your current adrenalin level, you may or may not gain adrenalin in different ways. But remember that you will always be losing adrenalin 
if you're not doing anything special, and you will lose it even quicker while sneaking. No speed-bridging allowed >:(

* **Sprinting :** the easiest way to get adrenalin, also the smallest gain. Efficient till tier 2

* **Jumping :** a good way to get adrenalin till tier 2

* **Eating :** an alternative for people who hate running
  * ***Golden apple:*** get your adrenalin directly to tier 1 threshold
  * ***Enchanted golden apple:*** get your adrenalin directly to tier 3 threshold

* **Being hurt :** not the safest way to get adrenalin as it means getting damaged, but quite efficient. Mob/player attacks, fall damage, ... you won't **ever** regret being low life *(joking, you will because you're gonna die right after it)*

* **Living dangerously :** embrace the path of the heroes, and face your destiny. The less armour you wear, the more adrenalin you gain, from all sources

* **Attacking :** definitely **THE** way to get adrenalin

* **DEATH :** the supreme way to get adrenalin ! Except not, because you lose all your adrenalin on respawning, so it's not really worth it... don't die

When reaching **tier 4 threshold**, you enter the *overcharged* mode. You will stay in this tier for a certain amount of time and your adrenalin will keep 
decreasing, no matter what you are doing, until you lose your whole adrenalin for this tier.

### Essence

Around the world, a new structure can spawn: ***the lost sanctuary***. A few gifts are waiting for you there (mainly death by poison... you'll understand), including a new block: ***the essence infuser***.

* **Using:** Standing on it and using a powered gem will give you the power of the gem. You may do this an unlimited number of times as long as you don't break the block

* **Charging:** If you want to bring the block home, breaking it will make it not infinite anymore. In order to use it again, you will need to charge it with ***essence*** before each use

* **Breaking:** After a *not-too-short* time breaking it, you will get the block and 1 to 3 essences if it was infinite, 0 to 1 if only charged

### Gems

To get a feat, you got it : you need different ***gems***. A gem is the basis of a power. It can be a damage, a heal, a miscellaneous, or a mobility one.

* **Powered gems:** Those gems are associated with a specific feat. You need a basic gem to create a tier 1 powered gem

* **More powered gems:** If you want to create a better tier gem, you will need a gem of the same power and of the previous tier. So yes, tier 4 needs a lot of basic gems

* **Using:** When you get the feat of a powered gem *(standing on a charged essence infuser)*, the essence infuser will consume it and give you back the basis gem along with 0 or 1 essence

### Feats

Now that you got your feat(s), there are a few things you need to know:

* **4 Tiers:** There are 4 tiers of feats that you can get. And you can get them in any order, with any kind of power

* **Not more:** If you try to get a feat of a given tier while you already had one on this slot, the new feat will replace the old one

* **Not dead yet:** Even if you die ~~(and you will)~~, you keep your powers

For a list of every feat, download the mod. Try, it's fun (and free !)

## Commands

* **Activate feat:** Some tier 2 feats may need a keybind to activate. ***LEFT ALT key*** by default

Note that you can change keybinds at any moment in Minecraft control options.

## FAQ
